This is a Language Server used for instance by
[Parol's VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsinger67.parol-vscode)
to support
[`parol`](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol.git)'s syntax of grammar description files (.par files).
This Language Server is developed with the help of `parol` itself.

## Features

The Language Server currently supports GotoDefinition and shows syntax errors as you are used to.

Further development on this server is planned.

## Installation

Please install this language server on your platform using the following command.

```shell
cargo install parol-ls
